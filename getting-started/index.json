{"title":"Getting Started","content":"\n# Gettings started with Mixeway\n\nInstallation of Mixeway is pretty straight forward. All you need is OpenSSL (or valid SSL Certificates)\nand docker-compose command, then clone repo\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Mixeway/MixewayHub\n```\ninitialize variables \n```bash\ncd MixewayHub\n./setup.sh\n``` \nThis operation will create certificates keys and key stores under `pki` directory and then just set `environment`\nvariables which are being set at dockers. Next,\n```bash\ndocker-compose pull\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\nwhich will run the Mixeway in background.\n\nFinally, use Your browser to navigate to\n```bash\nhttps://<Your-IP-Goes-here>\n```"}
