Define Scan Scope- it can be done manually via GUI, whenever needed user can manually define what he wants to scan and when he wants to run it. Other options is to use `REST API` that can be fired by any event e.g. in `CICD` pipeline.\n2. Configure Scan on Vulnerability Scanner - Mixeway has multiple scanner plugins that help to interact with number of security tools.
