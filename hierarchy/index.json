{"title":"Hierarchy","content":"\n\n## Object Hierarchy:\n<img src=\"https://mixeway.github.io/img/db.png\">\n\n###Project\nProject is top level object which describe subject (It can be IT System for example)\n\nProject contains information about:\n- Name\n- Description\n- externalID - to allow integration with third party vulnerability management systems\n\nElements of project:\n#### Asset\nAsset represent particular host. It can be saved via GUI, API or created automatically via IaaS API.\n\nAsset contains information about:\n- Interface (IPAddresses)\n- RoutingDomain (<a href=\"/routing-domains\">read more in routing domains section</a>)\n\n<a href=\"/network-scans\">Read more in Network scan section</a>)\n\n#### WebApp\nWeb App contains information about web application. Objects of webapp represent particular web application (or api endpoint).\nLoading webapps based on OpenApi Specification (swagger configuration file) is not yet supported\n\nWebApp contains information about:\n- URL\n- Headers (for authentication)\n- Cookies (for authentication)\n- Routing Domain (<a href=\"/routing-domains\">read more in routing domains section</a>)\n\n<a href=\"/webapp-scans\">Read more in WebApp Scan section</a>)\n\n\n#### Code Group and Code Project\nCodeGroup and CodeProject objects are related with Source Code Security Audits. If particular software is built from multiple microservices or components\nit could be logically grouped by Code Group otherwise each project which is a subject of a SAST testing should be stored as CodeGroup Object.\n\nCode Group and CodeProject objects contains information about:\n- Git Repo url\n- Git username\n- Git token (be sure that this token has proper rights as it will be used by SAST software to clone and fetch repo)\n- Git branch\n- Project name\n\nIn scenario where You have CodeGroup named `backend` and multiple microservices stored as CodeProjects, group contain information for\ngit user authentication and repo url is stored for each project individually\n\n<a href=\"/code-scans\">Read more in code scan section</a>)\n\n\n#### SoftwarePacket\nSoftwarePacket entity represent two types of software. First is related with library installed on a particular asset. Information about a package\ncan be used later on searching for published vulnerabilities (for example via Vulners). Second type of object related with software packet is\nCodeGroup and CodeProject in this context it is a particular OpenSource packet (for java or javascript library) similar to first type it is also\nused for searching published vulnerabilities\n\n<a href=\"/opensource-scans\">Read more in OpenSource scan section</a>)\n\n#### Vulnerability\n\nEach of above object can have stored vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities can be saved only via Automated security scans (for particular context).\nThere is no possibility to store vulnerability manually."}
