{"title":"Routing Domains","content":"\n## Conncept\nHaving in mind that many organization have multiple network zones and possibly no routing between them we have introduced concept of \nRouting Domains. Following this fact, in order to be able to properly prepare vulnerability scanning, You have to have installed multiple \nvulnerability scanners (per network zone). Routing Domains help to identify which vulnerability scanner should be used in order to\nrun test of particular object.\n\n\n### Example\nYou have 3 network zones: `A`, `B` and `C` where are installed three network vulnerability scanners. If project which has configured automatic scans\nwill contains Assets in all three zones, scan will be configured automatically on each vulnerability scanner.\n\n\n### Management\nRouting domains are completely managed by user. In administration panel administrator has possibility to delete and create new Routing Domains."}
