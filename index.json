There should be `pki` directory in the folder where docker-compose.yml is located. It is important that the `pki` directory will contain files:\n  - `ca.pem` which contains trusted root certificates (in pem format for nginx)\n  - `cert.crt` which contains public key in pem format\n  - `private.key` which contains private key in pem format\n  - `certificate.p12` PKCS12 file of cert.crt and private.key\n  - `trust.jks` which could be cacerts of JVM \n  \nThere is `setup` script prepared for `Unix` machines which generate certificates and prepare `environments`\n\nUsage:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/Mixeway/MixewayHub\n/bin/sh startup.sh\ndocker-compose pull\ndocker-compose up\n```\nYou can either use `setup` script or prepare environment on Your own using the guide above.\n\nMixeway will be available at https://__Your_IP_goes_here\n\n<img src=\"https://mixeway.github.io/img/createscan.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://mixeway.github.io/img/vulns.gif\">"}
