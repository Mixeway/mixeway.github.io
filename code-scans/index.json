{"title":"Code Scans","content":"\n\n### Source Code Security Audit:\nUsing Source Code Security Audit Mixeway can automatically run manage SAST scans by the API and jenins plugin.\n\n**_Avaliable integrations:_**\n\n<img src=\"https://mixeway.github.io/img/fortify.jpg\" height=\"50px\">\n<img src=\"https://www.checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Checkmarx-logo-2019-horizontal-4.png\" height=\"50px\">\n\n\n\n### Info\nCode Scanning is built from 2 objects - CodeGroup which may or may not contain child applications (CodeProjects). It is designed so one product\nwhich is build from multiple microservices could be still logically linked.\n\n<img src=\"https://mixeway.github.io/img/newcode.gif\">\n\n\n\n### Discovery\nIn order to use Code Scan plugin each CodeGroup has to be previously configured - Configuration->Source Code -> Add Code Group. \nFields like GIT repo and git username and password are obligatory to run the scan.\n\n\n### Integration goal\n* Configure scan - in scope of Microfocus Fortify it require additional software - use troubleshooting and contact us for the details\n* Run scan (scheduled, enabled manualy and REST API) - in scope of Microfocus Fortify it require additional software - use troubleshooting and contact us for the details\n* Load vulnerabilities\n\n### Recommended usage\nIdeal place to run Source Code Security Audit is before merge request (or pull request) is being done. Merge decision should be based on\nresults of a test\n\n### API usage:\n\n- Scan Execution\n\n```shell script\ncurl -X PUT \\\n    -H 'apiKey: {apiKey}' \\\n    https://localhost/api/sast/{projectId}/create/{groupName}/{projectName}\nResponse:\nHTTP 201\n{\"status\":\"OK|Qeueed\",\"requestId\":\"ffffffff-ffff-ffff-fffffffffff\"}\n```\n\n- Scan progres check\n\n```shell script\ncurl -X GET \\\n    -H 'apiKey: {apiKey}' \\\n    https://localhost/api/vulns/{projectId}/{codeGroup}/{codeProject}\nResponse:\nHTTP 200\n{\"commitId\":\"iuahsidh71d21dwa\",\"result\":\"Ok|Not Ok\", \"running:\":true, \"inQueue\":false, \"vulnManageResponseList\":[]}\n```\nWhere:\n    - Project has to be created (projectId avaliable)\n    - CodeGroup and CodeProject has to be created (groupName and projectName ) in the most scenarios groupName=projectName\n    - ApiKey is generated"}
